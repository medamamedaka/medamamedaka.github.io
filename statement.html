<h1>Artist Statement</h1>
<div class="w3-container w3-red">">
<p>I am traditionally an ink and paint artist. However in order to expand my horizon and take a step out of my comfort zone, I decided to try my hand at digital media art. In my digital works, I explore the surreal, the cartoonish, and the absurd. Most of my digital media projects incorporate juxtaposing elements to transform a seemingly innocent subject into something grotesque or unsettling. For instance, one of my works feature an infant doll head attached to the body of a caterpillar. Infants are normally seen as adorable, but when the body is replaced to that of a caterpillar, it alters the feeling of cuteness to disgust. My works also display influences from cartoons from my childhood and various elements of Japanese culture. Using digital media, I aim to further develop my own personal style, and explore new concepts and ideas that paints and inks cannot.</p>
