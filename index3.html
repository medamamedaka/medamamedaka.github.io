<h1>Artist Statement</h1>

<h3>I am traditionally an ink and paint artist. However in order to expand my horizon, I decided to try my hand at digital media art. My digital works aim to explore the surreal, the cartoonish, and the absurd. Most of my digital media projects also incorporate juxtaposing elements to create something grotesque or unsettling. For instance, infants are seen as adorable, but when a baby head is  attached to the body of a caterpillar, it creates a new feeling. My works also display influences from cartoons from my childhood and elements of Japanese culture. Using digital media, I wish to further develop my own personal style, and explore new concepts adn ideas that paints and inks cannot.</h3>
